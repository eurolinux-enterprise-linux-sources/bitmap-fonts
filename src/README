This package contains a number of bitmap fonts that are 
useful in situations like terminal programs.

The -misc-fixed family of fonts (4x6 - 10x20.bdf) are taken
from the ucs-fonts package (an updated version of the
misc-fixed fonts from the X distribution.)
 
 http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs-fonts.html

Most of these fonts are in the public domain; others
are under the X license. Copyright information where
applicable can be found in the .bdf files.

The Lucida fonts are also derived from the X distribution.
The file LU_LEGALNOTICE is the license that applies to the
original versions of these fonts.

The fangongti16.bdf fangongti24.bdf are merges of the
Fangosong ti fonts, and the Sony 8x16/12x24 fonts of
the same size to get full ASCII coverage. The licenses
of these fonts can be found in the .bdf files.
